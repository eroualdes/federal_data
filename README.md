# fd: analysis ready US federal data

fd is a command line application that provides analysis ready US federal data: one part [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com/) + one part [DATA.GOV](http://www.data.gov/) + APIs aren't for everybody = data in [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.

Install `fd` with

Currently, this project downloads only some of the available data from a select group of federal agencies.  Try
